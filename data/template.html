        <h1>Static outliers for {{ entity_name }}</h1>
        <p>There is substantial variation in prescribing behaviours, across various different areas of medicine. Some variation can be explained by demographic changes, or local policies or guidelines, but much of the remaining variation is less easy to
            explain. At <a href="https://openprescribing.net/">OpenPrescribing</a> we are piloting a number of data-driven approaches to: identify unusual prescribing, collect feedback on this prescribing to inform development of new tools to support
            prescribers and organisations to audit and review prescribing.</p>
        <p>The below reports have been developed to use “z-scores” to automatically identify prescribing patterns at a chemical level which are furthest away from “typical prescribing” and can be classified as an “outlier”. It is important to remember that
            this information was generated automatically and it is therefore likely that some of the behaviour is warranted. This report seeks only to collect information about where this variation may be warranted and where it might not. Our full analytical
            method code is openly available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ebmdatalab/outliers/">here</a> but briefly we calculate the number of prescriptions for each chemical in the BNF coding system using the BNF subparagraph as a denominator.
            We used the time period from {{ from_date }} to {{ to_date }}. We then calculate the mean and standard deviation for each numerator and denominator pair across all practices/CCGs/PCNs. From this we can calculate the “z-score”, which is a measure
            of how many standard deviations a given practice/CCG/PCN is from the population mean. We then rank your “z-scores” to find the top 5 results where prescribing is an outlier for prescribing higher than its peers and those where it is an outlier
            for prescribing lower than its peers.</p>
